## 📘 AVL Tree Based Dictionary (C++)

This project is a **Dictionary Management System** implemented in **C++** using an **AVL Tree** (self-balancing Binary Search Tree).
Each word is stored along with its **meaning**, and the AVL tree ensures **fast insertion and searching** by maintaining balance automatically.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **AVL Tree Implementation**

  * Self-balancing using LL, RR, LR, and RL rotations
* 📚 **Word & Meaning Storage**

  * Stores dictionary words with their meanings
* 🔍 **Prefix-Based Search**

  * Search words starting with a given prefix
* ➕ **Insert New Words**

  * Users can add new words and meanings dynamically
* ⚡ **Efficient Performance**

  * Guaranteed `O(log n)` time complexity for insert and search
* 🧠 **Preloaded Dictionary**

  * 130 default words (26 alphabets × 5 words each)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Data Structure:** AVL Tree
* **Concepts:**

  * Binary Search Trees
  * Tree Rotations
  * Recursion
  * Prefix Matching

## 📂 How It Works

1. The program loads a predefined dictionary with words and meanings.
2. Users are shown a menu:

   * Insert a new word
   * Search words by prefix
   * Exit program
3. The AVL Tree automatically balances itself after every insertion.
4. Prefix search displays all matching words along with their meanings.

## 📌 Sample Operations

```
1. Insert Word
2. Search
3. Exit
```

**Search Example:**
Input: `ca`
Output:

```
cat = a pet animal
car = a vehicle
cake = a sweet dessert
```
